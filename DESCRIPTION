Description: Provides partial least squares analysis for the analysis of the relation
    between two high-dimensional data sets. Includes permutation testing and
    bootstrapping for resulting latent variables (following McIntosh & Lobaugh (2004) <doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.07.020>)
    and several visualization functions.
